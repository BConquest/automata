# Automata

## Elementary Cellular Automata

This is contains the c code for running simulations of elementary cellular automata. The usage is `./a.out <size> <iterations> <rule: 0-255> <sleep time>`.
    - Size is the size of the board and it wraps around the board.
    - Iterations is the number of steps to run through
    - Rule is based off how [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) are set up for this style of cellular automata.
    - Sleep time is how long to delay between each step.

Some examples of it running are:
